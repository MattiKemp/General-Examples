1. STL: Standard Template Library
2. It consists of three components
    a. Container
    b. Iterator
    C. Algorithm

You want to use store information: Container.
You want to move through your stored data: Iterator.
- Iterators are inherently different given the container type.
    - Array: random access iterator.
    - List: traversal iterator.
You want to perform operations on your stored data: Algorithm.
