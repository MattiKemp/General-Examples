Transaction: something with input and output.

Example1:
Must use complete UTxO for transaction, Alice can't split up her 100 Ada and send only part of it, she must send all 100 Ada in the transaction.
So the transaction will have input UTxO of 100 Ada from alice, and an output UTxO with 90 Ada to her and a UTxO with 10 Ada for Bob.
Alice's original UTxO with 100 Ada is consumed at the end of the Tx.

To make it so Bob can't spend Alice's UTxO, we need signatures.
For Tx1, since Alice's money is being spent, she needs to provide
her signature to the transactions (her signing off on the transaction).

Script and Redeemer:
in Bitcoin, the script can only see the redeemer.
In Etherium, the script can see the entire blockchain.
In Cardano, the script can see all of the transaction, inputs, outputs, etc.

Datum, a piece of data that can be associated with a UTxO.
The script can then see all of the Tx as well as the Datum provided.
